\section{Segmentation performance}
\label{sect:perf}

This section compares the performance of each type of proxy model with respect to the teacher model.
The SAD, ND, MD, and OSD performances are presented in the table \ref*{tab:seg_results}.

The teacher's performance is considered the baseline.
The proxy models are expected to reach similar performance as the teacher.

The spectrogram-based system (spec.) shows 96.3\% and 95.5\% F1-score on the SAD task on DiHard and AragonRadio respectively.
This represents a little degradation with respect to the teacher.
The ND (73.0\%) and MD (87.6\%) are also degraded by an absolute -5,6\% compared to the teacher.
The strongest degradation is observed on the OSD with a 40.1\% F1-score.
The spectrogram-based model degrades the performance with respect to the teacher.
