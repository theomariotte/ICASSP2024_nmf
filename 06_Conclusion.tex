\section{Conclusions}
\label{sect:ccl}
This paper proposes a set of explainable proxy models for multilabel audio segmentation.
The proxy is trained to fit the logit distribution of a pre-trained black-box teacher model.
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is the core of this approach.
It allows to map the embedding used for the decision-making process to the frequency domain.
Hence, one can easily identify the relevant frequency bins used to predict the segmentation.
Experiments conducted on AragonRadio and DiHard III datasets show that the proxy model offers the same performance as the teacher while providing strong explainability capacities.

In the future, we plan to improve the spectrogram reconstruction in order to extract explanations in the audio domain.
Other training strategies will also be investigated to improve the segmentation performance of the spectrogram-based model.
